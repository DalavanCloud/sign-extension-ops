# Sign Extension Operators Proposal for WebAssembly

This repository is a clone of github.com/WebAssembly/spec/. It is meant for
discussion, prototype specification and implementation of a proposal to add
sign-extension operators to WebAssembly.

See the [overview](proposals/sign-extension-ops/Overview.md) for a summary of
the proposal.

Original README from upstream repository follows...

# spec

This repository holds the sources for the WebAssembly draft specification
(to seed a future
[WebAssembly Working Group](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-new-work/2017Jun/0005.html)),
a reference implementation, and the official testsuite.

A formatted version of the spec is available here:
[webassembly.github.io/spec](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/),

Participation is welcome. Discussions about new features, significant semantic
changes, or any specification change likely to generate substantial discussion
should take place in
[the WebAssembly design repository](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design)
first, so that this spec repository can remain focused. And please follow the
[guidelines for contributing](Contributing.md).
